**Compression Ratio:** 0.01

Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2025/60 of 15 January 2025 imposes a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of erythritol originating in the People's Republic of China. This regulation also definitively collects the provisional duty previously imposed on such imports and levies the definitive anti-dumping duty on registered imports of erythritol from China. The regulation aims to protect the European Union's economic interests by addressing the dumping of erythritol, which undermines fair competition and harms the EU market.

The regulation follows an investigation initiated by the European Commission based on a complaint regarding the dumping of erythritol. The investigation involved hearings with relevant stakeholders, including the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Medicines and Health Products (CCCMC), Rio Mints & Sweeteners B.V., Hamburg Fructose GmbH International, and users of the product. The Commission considered submissions from interested parties and revised its provisional conclusions accordingly. The final decision reflects the findings of the investigation, including the calculation of anti-dumping duties and the assessment of import prices.

Key aspects of the regulation include the methodology for determining the level of anti-dumping duties, the treatment of refundable value-added tax (VAT), and the establishment of benchmarks for fair pricing. The regulation addresses concerns raised by importers and other stakeholders regarding the accuracy of calculations, profit margins, and irregularities in import price assessments. By imposing definitive anti-dumping duties, the regulation seeks to ensure a level playing field for EU producers and prevent further market distortion caused by dumped imports.

**Summary Word Count:** 269  
**Compression Ratio:** 0.03

Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2025/70 of 9 January 2025 establishes protective measures against highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in certain Member States. The decision aims to prevent the spread of HPAI, a highly contagious viral disease affecting birds, which poses a significant threat to poultry populations and potentially to human health. It applies to specific geographic areas within the European Union where HPAI outbreaks have been confirmed or are suspected.

The decision implements a range of protective measures, including the establishment of protection and surveillance zones around infected premises, restrictions on the movement of poultry and poultry products, enhanced biosecurity requirements, and increased surveillance activities. These measures are designed to contain the virus, prevent its spread to unaffected areas, and minimize its impact on the poultry industry and public health.

Member States are required to ensure that the protective measures are effectively implemented within their territories, with particular emphasis on areas identified as high-risk. The decision mandates regular reporting to the European Commission on the implementation of these measures and the evolution of the disease situation. It also provides for the possibility of adapting the measures based on the epidemiological situation and scientific advice.

The decision is based on the legal framework established by Regulation (EU) 2016/429 (the "Animal Health Law") and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/687, which set out the rules for the prevention and control of transmissible animal diseases. It represents a coordinated EU-level response to the threat posed by HPAI, ensuring a harmonized approach to disease control across affected Member States.
